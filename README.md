##runPa11yScan

This is a tool to run the [Pa11y](http://pa11y.org/) website accessibility checker over a set of websites, depositing the output into a single json file for use on a custom website. 

For most use cases, [Pa11y's dashboard](https://github.com/springernature/pa11y-dashboard) functionality will likely be a suitable solution, providing a clean graphical interface and tracking capabilities. This tool was put together specifically to pull the raw data generated by the [Pa11y command line tool](https://github.com/springernature/pa11y), and was built especially for [Pulse.cio.gov](https://pulse.cio.gov), a project of the [General Services Administration](https://gsa.gov)/[18F](https://18f.gsa.gov). 

In order to run this tool, you will have to have Pa11y properly installed. The instructions for how to do this can be found on the [Pa11y github page](https://github.com/springernature/pa11y). 

Besides Pa11y command line, this tool itself has very few dependencies (available in requirements.txt). It has only been tested on Python 3.4. 

The current version only scans the domains found the file labeled 'domains.csv'. We plan to modify the code to support other files once it is stable, but for now, you can run this yourself by hard-coding the path to your own (similarly-formatted) csv file.
